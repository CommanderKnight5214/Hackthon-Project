# Hackthon Projects

These projects were completed during a Hackathon Event, and each project was worked on by a team that I was either on, or leading during each Hackathon Event. If I were to define what a Hackathon is, a Hackthon by definition, according to Google, is: "an event in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming." Essentially, people are divided into teams, and each team has a goal to create an application that is outlined by the people hosting the hackathon. Each project will define what the goal is, along with what the application that the team created, and each of the projects that I created can be listed as follows: 

* [Galactris Project](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/PastProgrammingProjects/tree/main/Hackathon%20Projects/Tetris)
* [Cash Register Application](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/PastProgrammingProjects/tree/main/Hackathon%20Projects/Cash%20Register)
